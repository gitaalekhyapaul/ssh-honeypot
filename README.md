# ssh-honeypot

In this project, we have implemented an SSH honeypot, which will act as a proxy server for any central server. 
A honeypot is used to track the behavior of attacks that are done on any main servers. The function of a honeypot is to represent itself on the internet as a potential target for attackers (usually a server or other high-value asset) and to gather information and notify defenders of any attempts to access the honeypot by unauthorized users.
